% function aoicompare(inputxy,ghandles)
%
% This function is intended to help located corresponding aois
% in the Cy3 and and alexa488 aoi lists during the tricolor oligo
% experiment.  We will input the x and y coordinates of one aoi from
% e.g. the Cy3 list, and look for the corresponding aoi in the 
% alexa488 list (aoiinfo2).  The program will find the closest aoi
% in the aoiinfo2 list, and it is up to the user to make the decision
% as to whether those two aois are actually coincident.
%
% inputxy == [x y] the x and y coordinates of our input aoi.  We are
%               trying to find which aoi in the aoiinfo2 list is actually
%               closest spatially to this input aoi
% ghandles == the handles structure from the calling gui.  e.g.
%           handles.FitData = aoiinfo2 (see below)
% aoiinfo2 = list of aois output by imscroll when the user is tracking a
%              time course for the appearence of dye spots
%              [frame#  ave  x   y  pixnum  aoinum (danny's original aoi#)]
%
% The function will return the aoinum from the aoiinfo2 list that
% identifies the aoi minimizing:
%   (inputxy(1) - x)^2  + (inputxy(2) - y)^2 )
